    "text": "Chapter 9: Putting Probability and Statistics Together\nWhat is a Random Variable?\nA random variable is a value that changes randomly. If we repeatedly take samples, statistics like sample means and proportions will vary. These variations form a sampling distribution.\nExample: Rolling a dice 10 times and counting the number of “6”s. Repeating this 100 times produces a predictable pattern for the number of 6s.\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\nRandom sampling produces a predictable pattern and connects to the idea of a sampling distribution. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) as sample size increases, regardless of the population’s original shape.\nExample: Imagine measuring the weights of apples. The individual weights may vary, but the average weight from multiple samples will form a normal distribution.*\nConfidence Intervals\nA confidence interval estimates a range of plausible values for a population parameter (e.g., mean or proportion). A 95% confidence interval means that, if repeated, the true value will fall within this range 95% of the time.\nExample: Surveying 100 students about daily screen time. If the average is 3 hours with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8–3.2 hours, this suggests the true average lies in this range.*\n\n\nChapter 10: Answering Questions and Claiming Discoveries\nSignificance Testing and Hypotheses\nHypothesis testing starts with a null hypothesis (e.g., no effect). Data is compared to this hypothesis to determine if the observed results are significant.\nExample: A company tests whether a new fertilizer increases crop yield. The null hypothesis states “no effect,” but if the data shows significant growth compared to untreated crops, the null is rejected.\nP-Values and Statistical Errors\nA P-value measures the probability of observing results as extreme as the current data under the null hypothesis. Small P-values (e.g., &lt;0.05) indicate significance. Errors:\n\nType I Error: Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive).\nType II Error: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).\n\nExample:A fire alarm sounds when no fire is present (Type I).A smoke detector fails to trigger during a fire (Type II).\nP-Value Interpretation and Over-Reliance\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\nP-values should not be the sole criterion for conclusions. Practical significance, confidence intervals, and replication of results are equally important.\nExample: A new drug reduces recovery time by just 1 hour. Even if the P-value is significant, the practical benefit might be minimal.\n\n\nReferences\nSpiegelhalter, D. (2019). The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data. Pelican Books.."
